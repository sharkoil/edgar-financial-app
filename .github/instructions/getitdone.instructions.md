Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the project, including key directories and their purposes (e.g., `webapp`, `services`, `static`, `templates`).

2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding standards and best practices for Python, FastAPI, and any other relevant technologies.

3. **Logging**: Use the logging framework consistently for debugging and tracking application behavior. Include relevant context in log messages.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling throughout the application. Use HTTPException for API errors and provide clear error messages.

5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for all API endpoints, including request/response formats and examples.

6. **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests for critical components of the application. Ensure tests are automated and cover a range of scenarios.

7. **Security**: Follow security best practices, including input validation, authentication, and authorization. Be mindful of potential vulnerabilities.

8. **Performance**: Optimize for performance where necessary, including efficient database queries, caching strategies, and asynchronous processing.

9. **Collaboration**: Communicate effectively with team members and stakeholders. Be open to feedback and willing to iterate on solutions.

10. **Continuous Improvement**: Stay informed about new developments in relevant technologies and methodologies. Seek opportunities to improve the codebase and development processes.

11. **Rate Limiting**: Do not overload the API with requests. Implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.
